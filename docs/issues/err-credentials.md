ER-3: Failure to register accounts

### Description
An account could not be created to log into the plugin and access functionality. The Moodle review team reported that attempts to create an account at the EduTech Repository website were unsuccessful. As a result, the review team requested an account to test the EduTech plugin functionality. The message received by the EduTech review team can be seen in the following figure.

### Solution
At first, a temporary account was granted to the Moodle review team. 
- User: teacher@ups.edu.ec
- Password: USER12345
As a permanent solution, the account registration for the EduTech Repository was updated to enable users to create an account with public domain emails.
